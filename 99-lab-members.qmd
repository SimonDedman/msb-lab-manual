Create markdown doc from /R/labs-members-metadata-comms.R

Need to improve code for labs websites scraping to tables. Bard did it but its code doesn't work.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
labs_members <- read.csv(file = "data/labs_members.csv")
DT::renderDT({labs_members})
```

Test. If you see this, the table above isn't working.
