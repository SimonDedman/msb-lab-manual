This Quarto book is intended to be used for **incoming, current, and outgoing** members of the MSB. It is designed to be collaboratively edited by its users, rather than the work of one individual. To make changes, do a pull request and your changes will be reviewed then pulled into the manual for everyone to see & benefit from.

## How to do a pull request

1. Fork project on github (top right).
2. In yout GitHub forked project, click green "code" button, copy git address.
3. In a folder on your filesystem: "git clone [gitaddress]".
4. Go to new subfolder, open Rproj in RStudio.
5. Make changes in your local files in RStudio, test, devtools::document(), 'git commit push' to your own Github fork.
6. Go to original (other person's) package, pull requests, create, "compare across forks", select your fork as the right hand side. "Create pull request" button.
7. If it's not automatically named correctly, name it well. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue.
8. Example: https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/pull/1898
